# Book Management CRUD Application

## Description

This project is a PHP-based CRUD application for managing books and users. It uses MySQL with PDO for database interactions and implements secure user authentication using password hashing and verification. The application allows users to:

- **Manage Books:** Create, read, update, and delete book records.
- **User Management:** Register new users, log in securely, and manage existing users (edit or delete users).
- **Session Handling:** Maintain a session that stores user details (ID and username) upon successful login and display the online userâ€™s name in the header.
- **Modern UI:** The application is built with a responsive, clean, and modern interface using HTML and CSS.

The project is organized into directories to separate configuration files, reusable includes, public-facing pages, and SQL scripts for easy maintenance and scalability.
